# jeversee
A Python film scraper using BS4, requests, regex and Flask to assemble specific data points from different cinema websites into a quick-info search engine with an efficient minimalistic frontend. 

This project taught me about key Python libraries, the different commercial approaches to data-scraping, the value of efficient code structure and pre-planning to prevent excessive future bug-fixing, and thinking through an app backend logic knowing that I’ll also be developing a corresponding frontend. I also learned a lot about python server configurations, the different formats and incredible value of error and server logs, and appreciating different python IDEs for specific goals.

I removed the actual main.py file while I learn the full impact of allowing forking, disabled rulesets and log visibility :D
